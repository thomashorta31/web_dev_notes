Devry Education Group Scholarship Fund

Dear Sir / Madam:

It is my great pleasure to write this letter in support of Mr. Edmund Fernandez to receive your esteemed educational institution's Group Scholarship Fund.

I instructed Mr. Fernandez for CIS363B last session. This class was an introduction to Web Technologies. In my class I introduce a variety of complex topics and not many students grasp all of them but Edmund, through effort and personal interest, gained great insight and delivered an above average final project. The class was scheduled on a Friday night from 6pm to 10pm but that time did not deter Edmund form attending class and participating every session. In the online portion of the class, Edmund took the time to engage his fellow students on the weekly topics. He turned his assigments in on time and it was a pleasure to have him in class.

Based on my observation of his abilities, I believe Edmund has the desire necessary to excel at Devry University. I recommend for Edmund to receive the Devry Education Group Scholarship Fund. Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information.

Yours sincerely,

Philip Howley, MBA
Professor 
Devry University
