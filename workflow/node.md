# Node

## Install Node
* Type `npm` in terminal

```
$ npm
```

* You will get `command not found` error which just means you don't have `node.js` installed.

[Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Download latest `stable` version

* After installing if you type `npm` into iTerm you will get output letting you know you now have node and `node package manager` (aka `npm`) on your mac OS.
